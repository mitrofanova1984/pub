All of us know the phrase from childhood that appetite comes during meals or the assurances in the possibility just through daily professional exercises to enter this special state. But I still consider inspiration to be an insight same as most of the geniuses of the past. I can sit at the table for a few hours, making sketches and not come to the desired result, and I can instantly make the image exactly as I think in the most original way. I consider inspiration to be this trigger in my head, an unpredictably working speed and mode switch.</div><div>Following the doctrine of the Russian philosopher Berdyaev, art is the final and already chilled product of creativity, always a bit stiff and usually unsatisfactory for the creator. Berdyaev assigns the role of the first violin to the idea. The idea is the root of the genius of the future work. Berdyaev only casually mentions the problems of inspiration, concentrating on the theme of the divine nature of the idea. About inspiration philosopher says that this topic will be studied some day in the future. During the work on this essay, I tried to consider the nature of inspiration and its sources, to find answers to the questions that interest me, set out below.</div><div><br></div><div>Nietzsche in his concept divides art into Apollonian and Dionysian. He assigns to the Apollonian the features of rational, illusory-optimistic, measured and individual. Opposite for the Dionysian - irrational, tragic-heroic, troubled, devoid of individual through mystical unity. Nietzsche believes that the ideal state is a balance between the Apollonian and Dionysian beginning. Jung adapted Nietzsche's dualistic system for his classification of psychological types. He contrasted the rational Apollonian with the sensual Dionysian. I presented my initial idea of the dual system based on the synthesis of Berdyaev, Nietzsche and Jung's doctrines in the form of the following thesis: not only art itself as a final product, not only the idea as a basis for the creation of the work, but also the sources of inspiration (necessary for the creation of the work), can be divided into Apollonian and Dionysian. From Berdyaev, I took the idea of the supremacy of the idea over the result and added to it the dominance of inspiration over the idea. From Nietzsche I took the conflict and the search for a balance between Apollonian and Dionysian in art. From Jung endowment the Dionysian aspect with sensual and Apollonian with rational. The double determination, in their opinion, sets the dynamic tension that feeds the culture. To the Apollonian I firstly took: sports, travel, love, meditation and austerities, nature. To Dionysian: alcohol, drugs, violence, sexual perversions, tabooed by society.</div><div>One of the starting points of my research is the work of Berdyaev "The destiny of a man." Berdyaev strongly criticizes psychoanalysis as the only true system explaining human nature in this book. Berdyaev laments that: "the modern psychology of the unconscious, opening a terrible underground of darkness, exposing the low-lying nature of the highest state, in itself destroys a person, tramples him into the mud." Nevertheless, in contrast to this statement Berdyaev can oppose only the thesis of the divine nature of a man, saying: "Man is a being, aspiring to the highest values and benefits, to the highest divine existence. Therefore, psychology, opening in man the abyss of darkness, contradiction and flour, should also open in man the image and likeness of God and Creator of values." Finally, the philosopher makes a note that creativity has a fundamental basis in the unconscious, and imagination arises from the bottomless freedom. In my opinion, the idea of the divine nature of creativity sounds pretty tempting, but the obvious remark about the unconscious ("dark water", as Berdyaev called it) brings me back to a critical assessment of this concept. The arguments of the adherents of psychoanalysis seem to me more reasoned. Following the theory of Freud's division into "Ego", "Id", "Super Ego", where the base is "Id", I came to a certain conclusion. "Ego" is trying to control the "Id", which is further regulated by the internal censor "Super Ego". It can be assumed (on the basis of empirical experience) that the sphere of creativity is embedded in the "Id". This is the sphere of the sensual, irrational, pre-individual, animal. It is the same set of concepts as that of Dionysian by Nietzsche or Jung. For Nietzsche, the Dionysian aspect was a way to expand the possibilities of knowledge of the world. From this "Id" artists can endlessly draw energy and inspiration for their creations. Even the opponent of the idea of the "low" nature – Berdyaev, - was forced to notice: "a Man tries to break through to the beyond consciousness, to the upper abyss, falling not infrequently into the unconscious, into the lower abyss". After analyzing the Apollo sources I considered that it can somehow come to the same "Id". It is possible to look at them through the prism of dominance, immersion to the occultism or mysticism, which exactly is, the dissolution of their own individuality. Love in general gives such a wide range for the interpretation of various pathologies that it became long ago a topic of a separated study. Thus, I changed my thesis about the division of inspiration sources into Apollonian and Dionysian, radicalizing the concept. Finally, I place all sources of inspiration in the area of the Dionysian. The scheme is simple: if creativity is a system of the sensual, then only the sensual can inspire it. Nevertheless, in this essay, I would like to focus my view on the socially reprehensible, tabooed sources. And although socially acceptable sources, as I tried to prove above, are not better in their basis of "stigmated" in society, still sources of inspiration of the first group carry a greater conflict. From the acceptability of stimulating inspiration by tabooed tools and personal fear (or Vice versa readiness) of the artist to "play with matches" to the tendency in the world of art to endlessly exploit the theme of the unconscious and attempts to find a balance between the risk areas and safe for the artist's personality.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>The scandal with Harvey Vanstein in the fall of 2017 once again broke the theme of the framework of acceptable in the world of art. However, it recalled how this "dark" area of show business and bohemian life is hidden from the public eyes. We can only guess what the real situation is in the art world after the scandals with Roman Polanski, Kevin Spacey or the already mentioned Harvey Vanstein. In the Studio of the Russian artist Kiprensky in Italy there was found a dead model, according to declassified correspondence of Tchaikovsky, he suffered from not shared (or shared) love to his nephew, who at that time was 13 years old, Da Vinci in his youth was involved to a scandal with the murder of 17-year-old model, Gauguin enjoyed the status of a colonizer in Tahiti regarding actually disenfranchised local women, Dali boasted his participation in orgies, van Gogh considered visiting a brothel a necessary part of leisure. The facts on this list are difficult to obtain, as the society, although it condemns artists for unacceptable behavior, still wants to use their achievements, washing their reputation for this. As my friend cynically remarked, discussing this topic: "50% discount for geniuses." I have the impression that there is a social contract between the privileged artistic community and the rest of society. Consciously or unconsciously allowing artists to have the need in, let's call it, experimentation, society looks through the fingers where artists draw their inspiration. The main principle of this contract becomes a hypocrite aspect: not caught - not a robber. It is also interesting why the society gives the artists this carte Blanche. Here I can only assume, basing my guesses on Kant's thesis and Jung's theory. Kant asserted the special position of the artist in the society. In fact, Kant was the first who transferred the artist from the craftsman class to the category of Creator, giving him special features and functions. This idea has become one of the components of the social values’ system and aesthetic perception of modern man. Jung, in addition to dividing human nature into rational and sensual, was the first to formulate the idea of the collective unconscious. The collective unconscious by Jung originates in the archaic past of man (even, perhaps, Pro-man). I interpret these two Jung's thesis as follows: the Collective unconscious that Dionysian or sensual, which makes a universal code for all humanity. Archaic fear of darkness or public speaking may be understood by people of different cultures, religions and ages. This is the "Id" by Freud or "dark water" by Berdyaev. Without stating anything, but only putting forward a hypothesis, I assume that the unconscious of the artist is not different from the unconscious of any other person. Society needs people who, due to natural talent and acquired skills, can bring this collective unconscious into the common field by creating works of art. Shocking, terrible, passionate, depressing, tragic is clear for everyone. I remember an experiment in which the natives of one of The African tribes were suggested to listen to the music of Bach. On people living primitive communal system, the music brought same impressions as on any of us. I see this as one of the manifestations of the ancient, connecting all people on Earth, archaic origin. The society is interested in such communication, the state is interested in expanding the tools of propaganda (fire processions in Nazi Germany, the military aesthetics of parades in the USSR, etc.), management is interested in increasing sales and box office, the artist is interested in self-expression and the opportunity to reach out to the viewer. I suppose that everything I have stated is connected with both the reason the artists receive tacit indulgences and the roots of the popularity of Dionysian art today. Economically prosperous societies living in the Western European system of values need a natural internal aesthetic regulator and stimulus. This regulator and irritator is an artist.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>As a separate major subspecies of Dionysian sources of inspiration, condemned by society, I would like to make drugs, alcohol and any other experiments with the artist’s own consciousness. In the 20th century there was a series of experiments by the University of California Irvine psychiatrist Oscar Janiger. During the experiment, professional artists under the influence of hallucinogenic drug were offered to make a series of portraits of Janiger (later a special doll) in any preferred materials by choice. The aim of the experiment was to see how the perception of the artist, style and ability of work change. Janiger's resume, in my opinion, deserves attention. He declaimed that the artist is able to create a more vivid and non-standard result under the influence of hallucinogens, but provided the possession of talent and technical skills. Published his book a year before the Janiger's experiments, Huxley wrote: "by taking mescaline, you better understand how other minds work." With this phrase, he proves my conclusion that, drawing inspiration from the unconscious, the artist goes beyond his individuality, dissolving in the collective. Individual by Huxley is "self", to overcome which is the “main appetite of the soul”. Huxley, perhaps, most openly calls to dissolve in "dark water", claiming in this salvation from the monotony of life. "But the need for frequent chemical vacations, giving a rest from the unbearable self and disgusting environment of the environment, it is undeniable, will remain the same." Now this call sounds in the best case naive, in the worst – propagandistic. But Huxley in his essay "doors of perception" recites 2 interesting thoughts. 1. "When, for whatever reason, men and women fail to excel themselves through religious worship, good work and spiritual exercise, they are prone to turn to chemical surrogates of religion – to 'wheels' in the West, to alcohol and opium in the East, to hashish in the Muslim world, to alcohol and marijuana in Central America, to alcohol and Coca in the Andes, to alcohol and barbiturates in more modern areas of South America." In other words, the author says that taking the drug is a guaranteed ticket to the unconscious. That is, the very place where you can draw inspiration and where you can reunite with the collective unconscious. In addition, resorting to the drug, you can achieve the overcoming of "self" much faster. 2. "Instead of transforming children into fully developed adults, it (education) produces students of the natural Sciences who are completely unaware of Nature as an initial fact of experience, it imposes on the world students of the Humanities who know nothing about humanity, whether their own or someone else's." I interpret these words as a regret that there is no place for occultism in the education system, that is, merging with nature, again going beyond individuality and dissolving in "dark water". By the way, the theologians of the middle Ages spoke about the Dionysian beginning of nature long before the emergence of this dual system. They saw the nature as destructive, demonic, irrational, real "Id". In this regard, I still remember the film of Lars von Trier "Antichrist", where chthonic, natural and female sharply opposed to rational, male. Also, referring to the artists, Huxley says that "the best art, causing vision, created by people who themselves have spiritual experience." And it is very, very difficult to argue with this, remembering all those great names that experimented with their consciousness. On the other hand, there is a huge risk for the artist. In Russia, there is a well-known example of Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol, who tested this reality for strength so intensely, so deeply immersed in the occult devoid of individuality unconscious that it absorbed him, driving him crazy and eventually killing him. The unhappily famous club "27", which includes world-famous musicians who died early because of their depression and addictions. I assume that the destructive and therefore frightening Dionysian, can also be hypnotically attractive even with the foreseeable prospect of death. It reminds me my feeling when I was standing at the mountain gorge, and it was very scary. Fear did not allow to come close to the edge, but at the same time unknown force pulled me to the cliff, putting me to a condition of euphoria. If we assume in Dionysian the same hypnotic force, the same euphoria, it becomes quite obvious why so many creators do not resist killing them by "dark water". Perhaps this risk is the price that the artist must pay for the right to use Dionysian sources of inspiration. Whether to resort to the help of this guaranteed ticket to the unconscious by Huxley, the area of responsibility of each individual Creator. I do not see a universal recipe for today, how the artist can protect himself from possible damage that can cause his life and health Dionysian sources of inspiration.</div><div>Summing up his essay, I want to say that every artist chooses sources of inspiration according to the organization of his psyche. For some, it is a romantic story with inspiring them people, and for someone traveling to Africa and Asia. Despite the fact that at the "Id" level we are all similar, at the "Ego" level everyone has their own personal history, which largely determines which source the artist will resort to.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>The well-known Russian-Israel psychologist Michael Labkovsky believes that creative people are mostly unhappy neurotics. To cure these people of their neuroses is possible, and they may become happy. But the paradox is that when they become happy, they will not want to create anymore. According to Labkovsky, not every neurotic artist is an artist, but every artist is a neurotic. And the neurosis is a special code, which make the artist suffering without inspiration, feeling himself not talented or struggling for the better result, but same time this code make the artist a unique media by himself. Each “media” may choose, which sources to use, while the result is satisfying.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Text by Svetlana Mitrofanova.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div>
