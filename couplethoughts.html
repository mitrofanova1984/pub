My guests are the greatest stars of philosophy. They are dead long ago, but they can talk to me only from the pages of their works. I imagine them being rock stars resting in the dressing room before the concert. I am pleased to have this amazing opportunity to interview them in order to try to answer myself one of the most interesting for me questions: "How correctly I have defined the criteria by which I can judge the work of art on the authenticity of Fine Arts?" Based on my reading of Aristotle's Poetics, Kant's Critics of judgment and Berdyaev's Destiny of a man, I have listed the following theses: art is not obliged to be nice, the requirement of originality from the artist, the concept of freedom, from which follows the concept of originality, the power of the idea of the work, through which there is a breakthrough to the metaphysical by the artist.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>- You all created ideas that later formed the basis of the methodology of the arts studying. I understand that your theories about freedom, ethics and art were based on each other's works, so Aristotle's idea as a pioneer was expressed more generally than, let’s say, Berdyaev's idea. I would like to start with the first principle of the arts definition that I have outlined for myself: "Art does not have to be nice and bring pleasure" - and ask Aristotle first to comment on this thesis.</div><br><div><br></div><div>- I really do own the well-known words about the fact, that even if the impossible is presented (which in my opinion is absolutely not acceptable and is a mistake), but the art at the same time achieves its goal, let it be. With these words, I expand the tools of the artist and the entire Chapter "how to respond to criticism" give the artist an indulgence to move away from the need to imitate life. In this sense, my thought can be interpreted as a harbinger of Kant's thought. But in my view beautiful is kind, and kind is as if alive. If we consider "as if alive", as alive, but not necessarily kind and beautiful, we can conclude that" as if alive " is not obliged to be nice, but this idea was not yet in the paradigm of antiquity.</div><div><br></div><div>- Then I address my question to you, Immanuel. You are known for the aesthetic separation on pleasant and Fine Arts. And Fine Arts you trust already not be pleasant. This principle bases at the forefront of the contemporary art, which opens a real Pandora's box for the artist. How satisfied are you with the development of your idea, the interpretation of which you see in art today?</div><br><div><br></div><div>- Of course I did not aspire to create the field for different kinds of manipulations of artists whose desire of the scandal is higher than bringing ideas of idealism to a life of the society and the enrichment of society by these ideas. There is a whole list of names of artists who, only seem to fight against ideas of conformism, violence by mass culture, but same time without carrying in their activity my following postulate that the artist has to be original. These people for years "plow the same field" of commercial benefits, feeding the audience a cheap stuff just for the purpose of provocation. To be against became a mainstream and it’s paid well.</div><div><br></div><div>- Let me help you. Banksy?</div><div><br></div><div>- Yeah, the artist with the tenet of "feelings need to be insulted" is not a close one for me. A Scandal for the scandal... A provocation for the provocation… I don't see originality. In this sense, Warhol played with images of the mass culture, exposed consumerism and other social vices much more intelligent.</div><div><br></div><div>- But still in Banksy there is a way out of reality. Intuitively looking at his work, the viewer feels the artist's touch to the metaphysical. In his Disneyland, I see a clear invitation to explore his personal and same time collective unconscious of viewers. Finally, new subjects in the art simply don’t exist and the originality, in my opinion, lies in the power of the image and ability of the artist to pull over the audience. Leo Tolstoy named arts that, what can express thoughts and feelings.</div><div><br></div><div>- What would you say about a mechanical doll of Wolfson?</div><div><br></div><div>- I would say that Wolfson is a worthy successor to Warhol's ideas. In the sense that on the one hand, it is also puzzling…</div><div><br></div><div>- Excuse me for the interruption. One of my thoughts was that it is impossible to please what is not understood. Adjusted for epoch.</div><div><br></div><div>- Thank You, Aristotle. Yes, the confusion of the viewer is his indignation of the intellectual dominance of the artist and irritation of this. In this area lies "feelings need to be offend." But Wolfson is fully original, as the main focus of his work is the study of the dark depths of a man, where the viewer is not a victim, like in the Banksy’s game, but an executioner or tacitly endorsing violence witness. No niceness of his art is only a byproduct of his research topic.</div><div><br></div><div>- Did I understand correctly that in order for a product to be called a Fine Art work, it has be composed of all the principles set out by you?</div><div><br></div><div>- Yes, quite right. It is a system with several levels of the quality control. (everybody laughs)</div><div><br></div><div>- Nikolay Alexandrovich, you are the latest philosopher of my guests today. The book "the destiny of a man" is not even one hundred years old. I'd like to ask you how did you develop in this work the thesis of Kant that art is not obliged to be nice?</div><div><br></div><div>- At the base of my concept, I divided Fine Arts into design and idea. Design I refer to earthly art, already somewhat ossified and cooled. The true passion, life and genius I see in the idea and creative insight. I developed my colleague's idea that Fine Arts is the highest form of aesthetics. In my concept I have put the spirit above the aesthetics, and over the finished product the genius of the idea, raising it to the absolute. Fine Arts is only a pale shadow of intent, and in this I see the greatest tragedy of creativity. Considering the idea as the quintessence of beauty, from which art emerges later, I make it inseparable from the concept of freedom, which is in tune with Kant's thesis about freedom. Requiring freedom of the artist, I admit him getting forces from the dark, the ugly, subconscious part of his personality. As a result, the idea can be Dionysian and the final product, respectively, also does not have to be beautiful in the General sense.</div><div><br></div><div>- Do I understand correctly that if Kant tests a work for being Fine Arts, he uses the criterion "art is not obliged to be liked" and "originality determines in the artist", then you use the concept of freedom as an additional criterion?</div><div><br></div><div>- Quite true. Only the freedom in the idea and design can become a catalyst for the emergence of a brilliant creative idea. So begins to rotate the wheel of cultural epochs. If the artist is not blocked in borders of the canon as masters of ancient Egypt, or the Byzantine iconography or medieval period in Western Europe, it is inevitable that under the pressure of the Personality, there will come the progress and the epochs, personified by artists and cultural achievements, will be collected in a variable, high layer cake. I developed this idea of my colleague and supplemented it with metaphysical conclusions that only an artist who is free in his views, ideas and methods is able to touch the divine and eternal at the moment of creation. You can often hear the words of geniuses that they forget about time and the surrounding reality in moments of inspired work.</div><div><br></div><div>- "Man is the being through which is possible to burst to existence"?</div><div><br></div><div>- Exactly. A man is born an individual (I have given this word only a biological meaning) and only in the process of life, learning, gaining moral experience is able to become a person, which in turn can become an artist, who in turn can touch the eternal.</div><div><br></div><div>- Nikolai Alexandrovich, in the 2nd part of your book you focus at the dialectically contradictory relationship of the ethics of the law (in the pre-Christian and social-ordinary forms), the ethics of redemption (Christian morality) and the ethics of creativity. In your opinion, Kant considers the society within the framework of the ethics of the law, but the law saves human life. Why don’t you find the Kant’s view correct then?</div><div><br></div><div>- The ethics of the law organizes the life of the human masses, demonstrates the dominance of society over a particular person, over the private life of a person. The paradox is that the law has a positive value, because it not only cripples personal life, but really protects it. Ethics of Kant, in my opinion, is a legalistic ethics because it is interested in the obligatory moral law, the same for all human nature and leaves in the shadow of a living specific person with his moral experience and spiritual struggle. The moral of Kant that each person should be considered not as a means, but as an end in itself, is undermined by the fact that the person still turns out to be a means of implementing an impersonal, generally binding law. I oppose the ethics of the law to the ethics of creativity. What is new in this system of ethical values is that it affirms the primacy of the individual. On the way of this statement were F. Nietzsche and Dostoevsky. The calling and purpose of man in the world is revealed only in creativity.</div><div><br></div><div>- Aristotle, how do you think if there is a connection between the concept of catharsis formulated by you more than 2000 years ago and Berdyaev's statement about touching the existence through creativity?</div><div><br></div><div>- You mean, if it’s relative to any notion of catharsis to Berdyaev's metaphysics? I am sure that Yes: both are the strongest spiritual experiences for a person. In the process catharsis a man rises above the reality, experiences the whole range of emotions and finally, is cleared. As I understand it, this is what a colleague means when he is talking about the touching of existence. There is only one, but an important nuance – I'm talking about the purification and elevation of the viewer, while Berdyaev says the breakthrough to other worlds of the artist at the moment of creativity. In other words, we see the face of the evolution in art, when the focus shifts from the viewer (receiving) to the artist (giving). So arts becomes a closed structure – made by the person for the same person. Triumph of the individualism. (Berdyaev nods).</div><div><br></div><div>- Do you mean by eternal, God, existence the Orthodox interpretation of God, or is this more metaphysical concept for you?</div><div><br></div><div>- This is a complex issue. My philosophy is filled with contradictions, it is true. In ancient Greece, there was a short period of free philosophy until my colleague Aristotle made philosophy purely scientific. I insist that philosophy is an alive doctrine and cannot be fully rationalized as a science. All living things, and in the first place the person through whom I appeal to study philosophy (and use the term "anthropological philosophy") are inherently contradictory. Kant tells about the existence of a world, divine mind, and a man can only occasionally touch it, remaining a psychological being. I wonder if there can be a divine in man himself. And same is in my philosophy: heretical conclusions from the point of view of Orthodoxy about the equality of man to God, especially in the moments of creative rise, come into a conflict with the thesis that culture can enrich a person only if he was brought up in the system of Christian values. Therefore, it is difficult for me to give you an answer with 100% certainty. The symbiosis of religion, secular ethics and culture is too strong to be dissected. And what do you think?</div><div><br></div><div>- Me? I believe that the further course of history has shown the uselessness of the orientation to religion. This was firstly. And secondly, Christian values for long dominate almost all over the world. We see the values of equality, love and care for others, tolerance and pacifism more or less all over the world. people of different nationalities and cultural backgrounds study in universities, but equally talented, which I find amazing. And finally, thirdly, I agree that during immersion in work, there really comes a very strange meditative condition. As Jacques Cocteau said: "a Genius, no matter how amazing he was, always comes in its own time, and when this hour strikes, all the clocks in the world are beginning to be left behind." I feel the same contact with metaphysical, but I cannot accept that it is a God. I was raised in the humanistic values of the Christian world, that is true, but none of my parents were religious. In my opinion, this idea has a drawback, which is expressed in the empirical fail. But at the same time, I agree that I feel special spiritual experiences while engaging in creative work. In this regard, I would like to ask you one more question, Nikolay Alexandrovich: in your book you claim that "creative activity does not mean construction. The meaning is not in the object, not the subject, but the third - in the spiritual realm," or here's another: "the objectification will be a destroy, as for the meaning you have to join, but joining is not the objectification". You stand for intuition, but against psychology. For the spiritual, but against the subject. For the existence studying through a man, but against the knowledge through the nature or the subject. I think it could be a motto for all actionists, starting with Joseph Beuys.</div><div><br></div><div>- I am pleased that you brought a whole kind of art under my philosophical thesis (smiles). In fact, I would expand the limits of the indulgence given by me also on the adherents of non-figurative painting. Performances, for example, by Marina Abramovich or Joseph Beuys mentioned by you on the strength of the concentration of creative energy in them and the involvement of the audience in this act of shamanism really demonstrate an example of the artist's going beyond the objective reality.</div><div><br></div><div>- Oh, since Joseph Beuys was mentioned, I would like to ask all of you if the artist is a privileged member of society, a certain sacred cow, and most importantly – why? After all, it is Boyce who owns the words that everyone can be an artist.</div><div><br></div><div>- Firstly, the words of Beuys should not be interpreted literally and pull him out of the context of his time and social request, which artists are willing to play along. Secondly, if we proceed from my concept, according to which the main, "hot" stage is the idea, and the art is already a "chilled" result, the words of Beuys do not contradict with what I said. A brilliant idea can be created by anyone under certain circumstances. I write in particular that a man can love a woman with genius. And if we consider the artist only as the Creator of the concept, it really can be anyone.</div><div><br></div><div>- And do not forget that Beuys is already according to my theory of freedom and originality of the artist, only declares the right of everyone to be free and original, but this right I did not dispute. Neither me nor my colleagues. I was just saying that not everyone can be an artist, because not everyone can achieve a state of freedom and come to originality. Everyone is right, but not everyone can.</div><div><br></div><div>- This is not a simple question, because in open I do not mention it anywhere. However, I admire the skill, ingenuity and talent of ancient authors, as well as describe the complex structure of the tragedy, which certainly not everyone is able to create.</div><div><br></div><div>- I claim, after Kant, that the artist is a special person, developing according to the laws of the individual, and therefore elite. Society and civilization are developing according to the laws of collective and egalitarian. That is why the artist needs freedom so much in order to resist the social, which seeks to devour everything in its path.</div><div><br></div><div>- Yes-Yes, that is why you are the one of the first existentialists {smile}, but I’d like to ask you, what to do with this claim to the contemporary art, which becomes harder to understand, so as it becomes all more elitist?</div><div><br></div><div>- Nothing.</div><div><br></div><div>- Nothing.</div><div><br></div><div>- Nothing. Go on with your business.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Text by Svetlana Mitrofanova.</div></div>
